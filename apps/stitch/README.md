[Stitch](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/d/d2/Stitch_%28Lilo_%26_Stitch%29.svg/1200px-Stitch_%28Lilo_%26_Stitch%29.svg.png) is a Node.js microservice for checkout and payment, built for the FUBS monorepo. It integrates with Stripe (using adapter pattern. So the the payment provider can be changed) to manage payment sessions, webhooks, and order status, and is designed for robust, event-driven microservice architectures.

## üß≠ Payment & Workspace Access Flows

### 1. New User (No Workspace)

1. User chooses a plan.
2. User pays via checkout.
3. On successful payment, user gains access and can create a workspace.
4. User must re-pay monthly to maintain access.

### 2. Existing User With Workspace, Missed Payment

1. User does not re-pay for the next cycle.
2. User loses access to all their workspaces (cascade: also loses access to all projects, tasks, etc. within those workspaces) until payment is made again.
   - All workspace memberships (Owner, Admin, Member) are suspended for the user.
   - This ensures no access to any workspace data or related resources until re-payment.

### 3. Existing User With Workspace, Re-Pays

1. User re-pays for the next cycle.
2. User regains access to their workspace.

**Legend:**

- All workspace access checks in `sugarfoot-service` depend on the owner‚Äôs payment status, which is cached locally and updated by payment events from `stitch-service`.
- Payment events and webhooks are handled in `stitch-service` and propagated via RabbitMQ/outbox.
- If the owner is unpaid (i.e., `expiresAt` in the cache is in the past), all users (owner, admin, member) are denied access to the workspace and its resources.
- This enables eventual consistency and decouples the services for better scalability and reliability.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture & Responsibilities

- **Checkout Sessions**: Create, update, and manage checkout/payment sessions.
- **Webhooks**: Securely receive and process webhook events (payment succeeded, failed, refunds, etc).
- **Order Management**: Track order/payment status, persist transaction metadata.
- **Idempotency**: Ensure all payment and webhook operations are idempotent.
- **Security**: Validate all incoming requests (JWT for internal, signatures for webhooks).
- **Event-Driven**: Emit events (e.g., payment_completed) to other services via outbox pattern or message broker.

## Database Schema (Prisma)

The schema is found on [Prisma Schema](./prisma/schema.prisma)

## üß© StripeService Responsibilities & Stripe Resource Checklist

### Stripe Resources Required

To use this service, you will need to create and manage the following resources in your Stripe account:

- **Products**: One for each plan (e.g., Free, Solo, Enterprise)
- **Prices**: One for each product/plan and billing period (e.g., monthly, yearly)
  - Each price should match your `Plan` config (amount, currency, interval)
- **Webhook Endpoint**: For receiving payment events (e.g., payment_intent.succeeded, checkout.session.completed)
- **API Keys**: Secret and publishable keys for your environment
- **Webhook Signing Secret**: For validating incoming Stripe webhooks
- (Optional) **Customers**: If you want to track users in Stripe
- (Optional) **Subscriptions**: If you want to support recurring billing (vs. one-time checkout)

### üöÄ Implementation Strategy: Step-by-Step

Follow this plan to implement the Stitch service, based on the architecture and requirements above. Assumes the Nx NestJS app is already scaffolded.

### 1. Scaffold Data Models (Prisma)

- Define `Order`, `Outbox`, and `WebhookEvent` models in `prisma/schema.prisma`.
- Run `npx prisma migrate dev` to generate migrations and sync the database.
- Generate Prisma client and validate models.

### 2. Set Up Project Structure

- Create folders and files as per the recommended structure (see above).
- Add `.module.ts` files for each domain (checkout, webhook, orders, plans, outbox).
- Add DTOs for input validation.

### 3. Implement Plan Config & Business Logic

- Create `plans/plans.config.ts` with all plan definitions (see Plan interface).
- Implement `plans.service.ts` to expose plan data to the rest of the app.

### 4. Implement Order Management

- Implement `orders.service.ts`, `orders.repository.ts`, and `orders.entity.ts` for CRUD and business logic.
- Add validation and mapping between Prisma and entity classes.

### 5. Integrate Stripe Checkout

- Implement `checkout.controller.ts` and `checkout.service.ts` to create Stripe checkout sessions.
- Use Stripe SDK, map plan to Stripe price ID, and handle session creation.
- Store session/order data in the database.

### 6. Handle Stripe Webhooks

- Implement `webhook.controller.ts` and `webhook.service.ts` to receive and validate Stripe webhook events.
- Use Stripe signature validation and idempotency keys.
- Update order status and emit events as needed.

### 7. Implement Outbox/Event Publishing

- Implement `outbox/` module for the outbox pattern and RabbitMQ integration.
- Ensure payment events are published to other services (e.g., payment_completed).

### 8. Secure the Service

- Add JWT guards to all internal endpoints (except `/webhook/stripe`).
- Validate RBAC: users can only access their own orders.
- Harden webhook endpoint (Stripe signature only).

### 9. Add Error Handling & Observability

- Implement centralized error filters (NestJS).
- Add logging for all payment and webhook events.
- Expose health/readiness endpoints.

### 10. Testing

- Write unit tests for business logic and services.
- Add integration tests for Stripe flows (mock Stripe in CI).
- Test webhook signature validation and event publishing.

### 11. Deployment

- Ensure Dockerfile is production-ready.
- Use environment variables for all secrets.
- Add health checks and readiness probes.
- Use Prisma migrations for DB schema updates.
